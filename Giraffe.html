    <h2>Giraffe</h2>
    <p>
        The giraffe is a large African hoofed mammal belonging to the genus Giraffa. It is the tallest living terrestrial
        animal and the largest ruminant on Earth. Traditionally, giraffes have been thought of as one species, Giraffa
        camelopardalis, with nine subspecies. Most recently, researchers proposed dividing them into up to eight extant
        species due to new research into their mitochondrial and nuclear DNA, and individual species can be
        distinguished by their fur coat patterns. Seven other extinct species of Giraffa are known from the fossil
        record.

        The giraffe's chief distinguishing characteristics are its extremely long neck and legs, its horn-like
        ossicones, and its spotted coat patterns. It is classified under the family Giraffidae, along with its closest
        extant relative, the okapi. Its scattered range extends from Chad in the north to South Africa in the south, and
        from Niger in the west to Somalia in the east. Giraffes usually inhabit savannahs and woodlands. Their food
        source is leaves, fruits, and flowers of woody plants, primarily acacia species, which they browse at heights
        most other herbivores cannot reach.

        Lions, leopards, spotted hyenas, and African wild dogs may prey upon giraffes. Giraffes live in herds of related
        females and their offspring or bachelor herds of unrelated adult males, but are gregarious and may gather in
        large aggregations. Males establish social hierarchies through "necking", combat bouts where the neck is used as
        a weapon. Dominant males gain mating access to females, which bear sole responsibility for rearing the young.

        The giraffe has intrigued various ancient and modern cultures for its peculiar appearance, and has often been
        featured in paintings, books, and cartoons. It is classified by the International Union for Conservation of
        Nature (IUCN) as vulnerable to extinction and has been extirpated from many parts of its former range. Giraffes
        are still found in numerous national parks and game reserves, but estimates as of 2016 indicate there are
        approximately 97,500 members of Giraffa in the wild. More than 1,600 were kept in zoos in 2010.

        Etymology
The name "giraffe" has its earliest known origins in the Arabic word zarāfah ultimately from Persian (zurnāpā), a compound of (zurnā, "flute, zurna") and پَا‎ (pā, "leg").[3][4] In early Modern English the spellings jarraf and ziraph were used, probably directly from the Arabic,[5] and in Middle English jarraf and ziraph, gerfauntz. The Italian form giraffa arose in the 1590s. The modern English form developed around 1600 from the French girafe.[2]

"Camelopard" is an archaic English name for the giraffe; it derives from the Ancient Greek καμηλοπάρδαλις (kamēlopárdalis), from κάμηλος (kámēlos), "camel", and πάρδαλις (párdalis), "leopard", referring to its camel-like shape and leopard-like colouration.[6][7]

Taxonomy
Evolution
The giraffe is one of only two living genera of the family Giraffidae in the order Artiodactyla, the other being the okapi.[8] They are ruminants of the clade Pecora, along with Antilocapridae (pronghorns), Cervidae (deer), Bovidae (cattle, antelope, goats and sheep) and Moschidae (musk deer). A 2019 genome study (cladogram below) finds that Giraffidae are a sister taxon to Antilocapridae, with an estimated split of over 20 million years ago.[9]
