    <h3>Peacock: </h3>
    <div>
        The Indian peacock (Pavo cristatus) has iridescent blue and green plumage, mostly metal-like blue and green. In
        both species, females are a little smaller than males in terms of weight and wingspan, but males are
        significantly longer due to the "tail", also known as a "train".[2] The peacock train consists not of tail quill
        feathers, but highly elongated upper tail coverts. These feathers are marked with eyespots, best seen when a
        peacock fans his tail. All species have a crest atop the head. The Indian peahen has a mixture of dull grey,
        brown, and green in her plumage. The female also displays her plumage to ward off female competition or signal
        danger to her young.

        Male green peafowl (Pavo muticus) have green and bronze or gold plumage, and black wings with a sheen of blue.
        Unlike Indian peafowl, the green peahen is similar to the male, but has shorter upper tail coverts, a more
        coppery neck, and overall less iridescence. Both males and females have spurs.[3][page needed]

        The Congo peacock (Afropavo congensis) male does not display his covert feathers, but uses his actual tail
        feathers during courtship displays. These feathers are much shorter than those of the Indian and green species,
        and the ocelli are much less pronounced. Females of the Indian and African species are dull grey and/or brown.

        Chicks of both sexes in all the species are cryptically coloured. They vary between yellow and tawny, usually
        with patches of darker brown or light tan and "dirty white" ivory.

        Mature peahens have been recorded as suddenly growing typically male peacock plumage and making male calls.[4]
        Research has suggested that changes in mature birds are due to a lack of estrogen from old or damaged ovaries,
        and that male plumage and calls are the default unless hormonally suppressed.[5]

        Iridescence and structural colouration
        Further information: Iridescence and Structural colouration
        As with many birds, vibrant iridescent plumage colours are not primarily pigments, but structural colouration.
        Optical interference Bragg reflections, based on regular, periodic nanostructures of the barbules (fiber-like
        components) of the feathers, produce the peacock's colours. 2D photonic-crystal structures within the layers of
        the barbules cause the colouration of their feathers.[6] Slight changes to the spacing of the barbules result in
        different colours. Brown feathers are a mixture of red and blue: one colour is created by the periodic structure
        and the other is created by a Fabry–Pérot interference peak from reflections from the outer and inner
        boundaries. Color derived from physical structure rather than pigment can vary with viewing angle, causing
        iridescence.[7]

        iridescence.[7]

        Courtship
        Most commonly, during a courtship display, the visiting female peahen will stop directly in front of the male
        peacock – thus providing her the ability to assess the male at 90° to the surface of the feather. Then, the male
        will turn and display his feathers about 45° to the right of the sun's azimuth which allows the sunlight to
        accentuate the iridescence of his train. If the female chooses to interact with the male, he will then turn to
        face her and shiver his train so as to begin the mating process.[8]

        Evolution
        Sexual selection
        Charles Darwin suggested in The Descent of Man and Selection in Relation to Sex that peafowl plumage may have
        evolved through sexual selection:

        Many female progenitors of the peacock must, during a long line of descent, have appreciated this superiority;
        for they have unconsciously, by the continued preference for the most beautiful males, rendered the peacock the
        most splendid of living birds.

        Aposematism and natural selection
        It has been suggested that a peacock's train, loud call, and fearless behaviour have been formed by natural
        selection (with or without sexual selection too), and served as an aposematic display to intimidate predators
        and rivals.[9][10] This hypothesis is designed to explain Takahashi's observations that in Japan, neither
        reproductive success nor physical condition correlates with the train's length, symmetry or number of
        eyespots.[11]

        Female choice
        See also: Mate choice

        Peacock (seen from behind) displaying to attract peahen in foreground
        Multiple hypotheses involving female choice have been posited. One hypothesis is that females choose mates with
        good genes. Males with more exaggerated secondary sexual characteristics, such as bigger, brighter peacock
        trains, tend to have better genes[example needed] in the peahen's eyes.[12] These better genes directly benefit
        her offspring, as well as her fitness and reproductive success.

        Runaway selection is another hypothesis. In runaway sexual selection, linked genes in males and females code for
        sexually dimorphic traits in males, and preference for those traits in females.[13] The close spatial
        association of alleles[which?] for loci[which?] involved in the train in males, and for preference for more
        exuberant trains in females, on the chromosome (linkage disequilibrium) causes a positive feedback loop that
        exaggerates both the male traits and the female preferences.

        Another hypothesis is sensory bias, in which females have a preference for a trait in a nonmating context that
        becomes transferred to mating, such as Merle Jacobs' food-courtship hypothesis, which suggests that peahens are
        attracted to peacocks for the resemblance of their eye spots to blue berries.[14]

        Multiple causality for the evolution of female choice is also possible.

        The peacock's train and iridescent plumage are perhaps the best-known example of traits believed to have arisen
        through sexual selection, though with some controversy.[15] Male peafowl erect their trains to form a shimmering
        fan in their display to females. Marion Petrie tested whether or not these displays signalled a male's genetic
        quality by studying a feral population of peafowl in Whipsnade Wildlife Park in southern England. The number of
        eyespots in the train predicted a male's mating success. She was able to manipulate this success by cutting the
        eyespots off some of the males' tails:[16] females lost interest in pruned males and became attracted to
        untrimmed ones. Males with fewer eyespots, thus with lower mating success, suffered from greater predation.[17]
        She allowed females to mate with males with differing numbers of eyespots, and reared the offspring in a
        communal incubator to control for differences in maternal care. Chicks fathered by more ornamented males weighed
        more than those fathered by less ornamented males, an attribute generally associated with better survival rate
        in birds. These chicks were released into the park and recaptured one year later. Those with heavily ornamented
        feathers were better able to avoid predators and survive in natural conditions.[18] Thus, Petrie's work shows
        correlations between tail ornamentation, mating success, and increased survival ability in both the ornamented
        males and their offspring.
