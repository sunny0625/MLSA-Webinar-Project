    <h2>Leopard</h2>
    <p>
        The leopard (Panthera pardus) is one of the five extant species in the genus Panthera. It has a pale yellowish
        to dark golden fur with dark spots grouped in rosettes. Its body is slender and muscular reaching a length of
        92–183 cm (36–72 in) with a 66–102 cm (26–40 in) long tail and a shoulder height of 60–70 cm (24–28 in). Males
        typically weigh 30.9–72 kg (68–159 lb), and females 20.5–43 kg (45–95 lb).

        The leopard was first described in 1758, and several subspecies were proposed in the 19th and 20th centuries.
        Today, eight subspecies are recognised in its wide range in Africa and Asia. It initially evolved in Africa
        during the Early Pleistocene, before migrating into Eurasia around the Early–Middle Pleistocene transition.
        Leopards were formerly present across Europe, but became extinct in the region at around the end of the Late
        Pleistocene-early Holocene.

        The leopard is adapted to a variety of habitats ranging from rainforest to steppe, including arid and montane
        areas. It is an opportunistic predator, hunting mostly ungulates and primates. It relies on its spotted pattern
        for camouflage as it stalks and ambushes its prey, which it sometimes drags up a tree. It is a solitary animal
        outside the mating season and when raising cubs. Females usually give birth to a litter of 2–4 cubs once in
        15–24 months. Both male and female leopards typically reach sexual maturity at the age 2–2.5 years.

        Listed as Vulnerable on the IUCN Red List, leopard populations are currently threatened by habitat loss and
        fragmentation, and are declining in large parts of the global range. Leopards have had cultural roles in Ancient
        Greece, West Africa and modern Western culture. Leopard skins are popular in fashion.

        Etymology
        The English name "leopard" comes from Old French leupart or Middle French liepart, that derives from Latin
        leopardus and ancient Greek λέοπάρδος (leopardos). Leopardos could be a compound of λέων (leōn), meaning 'lion',
        and πάρδος (pardos), meaning 'spotted'. The word λέοπάρδος originally referred to a cheetah (Acinonyx
        jubatus).

        "Panther" is another common name, derived from Latin panther and ancient Greek πάνθηρ (pánthēr); The generic
        name Panthera originates in Latin panthera, a hunting net for catching wild beasts to be used by the Romans in
        combats. Pardus is the masculine singular form.

        Taxonomy

        Map showing approximate distribution of leopard subspecies
        Felis pardus was the scientific name proposed by Carl Linnaeus in 1758.[9] The generic name Panthera was first
        used by Lorenz Oken in 1816, who included all the known spotted cats into this group.[10] Oken's classification
        was not widely accepted, and Felis or Leopardus was used as the generic name until the early 20th century.[11]

        The leopard was designated as the type species of Panthera by Joel Asaph Allen in 1902.[12] In 1917, Reginald
        Innes Pocock also subordinated the tiger (P. tigris), lion (P. leo), and jaguar (P. onca) to Panthera.[13][14]

        Living subspecies
        Following Linnaeus' first description, 27 leopard subspecies were proposed by naturalists between 1794 and 1956.
        Since 1996, only eight subspecies have been considered valid on the basis of mitochondrial analysis.[15] Later
        analysis revealed a ninth valid subspecies, the Arabian leopard.[16]

        In 2017, the Cat Classification Task Force of the Cat Specialist Group recognized the following eight subspecies
        as valid taxa:

        Results of an analysis of molecular variance and pairwise fixation index of 182 African leopard museum specimens
        showed that some African leopards exhibit higher genetic differences than Asian leopard subspecies.[35]

        Evolution

        Two cladograms proposed for Panthera. The upper cladogram is based on the 2006[36] and 2009[37] studies, while
        the lower is based on the 2010[38] and 2011[39] studies.
        Results of phylogenetic studies based on nuclear DNA and mitochondrial DNA analysis showed that the last common
        ancestor of the Panthera and Neofelis genera is thought to have lived about 6.37 million years ago. Neofelis
        diverged about 8.66 million years ago from the Panthera lineage. The tiger diverged about 6.55 million years
        ago, followed by the snow leopard about 4.63 million years ago and the leopard about 4.35 million years ago. The
        leopard is a sister taxon to a clade within Panthera, consisting of the lion and the jaguar.[36][37]

        Results of a phylogenetic analysis of chemical secretions amongst cats indicated that the leopard is closely
        related to the lion.[40] The geographic origin of the Panthera is most likely northern Central Asia. The
        leopard-lion clade was distributed in the Asian and African Palearctic since at least the early Pliocene.[41]
        The leopard-lion clade diverged 3.1–1.95 million years ago.[38][39] Additionally, a 2016 study revealed that the
        mitochondrial genomes of the leopard, lion and snow leopard are more similar to each other than their nuclear
        genomes, indicating that their ancestors hybridized with the snow leopard at some point in their evolution.[42]

        The oldest unambiguous fossils of the leopard are from Eastern Africa, dating to around 2 million years ago.[43]

        Leopard-like fossil bones and teeth possibly dating to the Pliocene were excavated in Perrier in France,
        northeast of London, and in Valdarno, Italy. Until 1940, similar fossils dating back to the Pleistocene were
        excavated mostly in loess and caves at 40 sites in Europe, including Furninha Cave near Lisbon, Genista Caves in
        Gibraltar, and Santander Province in northern Spain to several sites across France, Switzerland, Italy, Austria,
        Germany, in the north up to Derby in England, in the east to Přerov in the Czech Republic and the Baranya in
        southern Hungary.[44] Leopards arrived in Eurasia during the late Early to Middle Pleistocene around 1.2[45] to
        0.6 million years ago.[43] Four European Pleistocene leopard subspecies were proposed. P. p. begoueni from the
        beginning of the Early Pleistocene was replaced about 0.6 million years ago by P. p. sickenbergi, which in turn
        was replaced by P. p. antiqua around 0.3 million years ago.[46] P. p. spelaea is the most recent subspecies that
        appeared at the beginning of the Late Pleistocene and survived until about 11,000 years ago and possibly into
        the early Holocene in the Iberian Peninsula.[46][47]

        Leopards depicted in cave paintings in Chauvet Cave provide indirect evidence of leopard presence in Europe.[46]
        Leopard fossils dating to the Late Pleistocene were found in Biśnik Cave in south-central Poland.[48][45] Fossil
        remains were also excavated in the Iberian[49][50] and Italian Peninsula,[51] and in the Balkans.[52][53]
        Leopard fossils dating to the Pleistocene were also excavated in the Japanese archipelago.[54] Leopard fossils
        were also found in Taiwan.[55]

        Hybrids
        Main articles: Panthera hybrid and Pumapard
        In 1953, a male leopard and a female lion were crossbred in Hanshin Park in Nishinomiya, Japan. Their offspring
        known as a leopon was born in 1959 and 1961, all cubs were spotted and bigger than a juvenile leopard. Attempts
        to mate a leopon with a tigress proved unsuccessful.[56]

        Rosettes of a leopard

        A melanistic leopard or black panther
        The leopard's fur is generally soft and thick, notably softer on the belly than on the back.[57] Its skin colour
        varies between individuals from pale yellowish to dark golden with dark spots grouped in rosettes. Its
        underbelly is white and its ringed tail is shorter than its body. Its pupils are round.[58] Leopards living in
        arid regions are pale cream, yellowish to ochraceous and rufous in colour; those living in forests and mountains
        are much darker and deep golden. Spots fade toward the white underbelly and the insides and lower parts of the
        legs.[59] Rosettes are circular in East African leopard populations, and tend to be squarish in Southern African
        and larger in Asian leopard populations. The fur tends to be grayish in colder climates, and dark golden in
        rainforest habitats.[60] Rosette patterns are unique in each individual.[61][62] This pattern is thought to be
        an adaptation to dense vegetation with patchy shadows, where it serves as camouflage.[63]

        Its white-tipped tail is about 60–100 cm (23.6–39.4 in) long, white underneath and with spots that form
        incomplete bands toward the end of the tail.[64] The guard hairs protecting the basal hairs are short, 3–4 mm
        (0.1–0.2 in) in face and head, and increase in length toward the flanks and the belly to about 25–30 mm (1.0–1.2
        in). Juveniles have woolly fur that appear to be dark-coloured due to the densely arranged spots.[61][65] Its
        fur tends to grow longer in colder climates.[66] The leopard's rosettes differ from those of the jaguar, which
        are darker and with smaller spots inside.[58] The leopard has a diploid chromosome number of 38.[67]

        Melanistic leopards are also known as black panthers. Melanism in leopards is caused by a recessive allele and
        is inherited as a recessive trait.[68][69][70][71] In India, nine pale and white leopards were reported between
        1905 and 1967.[72] Leopards exhibiting erythrism were recorded between 1990 and 2015 in South Africa's Madikwe
        Game Reserve and in Mpumalanga. The cause of this morph known as a "strawberry leopard" or "pink panther" is not
        well understood.[73]

        Size
        The leopard is a slender and muscular cat, with relatively short limbs and a broad head. It is sexually
        dimorphic with males larger and heavier than females.[64] Males stand 60–70 cm (24–28 in) at the shoulder, while
        females are 57–64 cm (22–25 in) tall. The head-and-body length ranges between 92 and 183 cm (36 and 72 in) with
        a 66 to 102 cm (26 to 40 in) long tail. Sizes vary geographically. Males typically weigh 30.9–72 kg (68–159 lb),
        and females 20.5–43 kg (45–95 lb).[74] Occasionally, large males can grow up to 91 kg (201 lb). Leopards from
        the Cape Province in South Africa are generally smaller, reaching only 20–45 kg (44–99 lb) in males.[65][66][75]
        The maximum recorded weight of a wild leopard in Southern Africa was around 96 kg (212 lb), and it measured 262
        cm (103 in).[76] In 2016, an Indian leopard killed in Himachal Pradesh measured 261 cm (103 in) with an
        estimated weight of 78.5 kg (173 lb); it was perhaps the largest known wild leopard in India.[77][78]

        The largest recorded skull of a leopard was found in India in 1920 and measured 28 cm (11 in) in basal length,
        20 cm (7.9 in) in breadth, and weighed 1 kg (2.2 lb). The skull of an African leopard measured 286 mm (11.3 in)
        in basal length, and 181 mm (7.1 in) in breadth, and weighed 790 g (28 oz).[79]

        Distribution and habitat

        A leopard grooming himself
        The leopard has the largest distribution of all wild cats, occurring widely in Africa, the Caucasus and Asia,
        although populations are fragmented and declining. It is considered to be locally extinct in North Africa.[2] It
        inhabits foremost savanna and rainforest, and areas where grasslands, woodlands, and riverine forests remain
        largely undisturbed.[60] In sub-Saharan Africa, it is still numerous and surviving in marginal habitats where
        other large cats have disappeared. There is considerable potential for human-leopard conflict due to leopards
        preying on livestock.[80]

        Leopard populations in the Arabian Peninsula are small and fragmented.[81][82][83] In southeastern Egypt, a
        leopard killed in 2017 was the first sighting of the species in this area in 65 years.[84]

        In Java, leopards inhabit dense tropical rainforests and dry deciduous forests at elevations from sea level to
        2,540 m (8,330 ft). Outside protected areas, leopards were recorded in mixed agricultural land, secondary forest
        and production forest between 2008 and 2014.[97]

        In the Russian Far East, it inhabits temperate coniferous forests where winter temperatures reach a low of −25
        °C (−13 °F).[16]

        Behaviour and ecology
        The leopard is a solitary and territorial animal. It is typically shy and alert when crossing roadways and
        encountering oncoming vehicles, but may be emboldened to attack people or other animals when threatened. Adults
        associate only in the mating season. Females continue to interact with their offspring even after weaning and
        have been observed sharing kills with their offspring when they can not obtain any prey. They produce a number
        of vocalizations, including growls, snarls, meows, and purrs.[65] The roaring sequence in leopards consists
        mainly of grunts,[98] also called "sawing", as it resembles the sound of sawing wood. Cubs call their mother
        with an urr-urr sound.[65]

        The whitish spots on the back of its ears are thought to play a role in communication.[99] It has been
        hypothesized that the white tips of their tails may function as a 'follow-me' signal in intraspecific
        communication. However, no significant association were found between a conspicuous colour of tail patches and
        behavioural variables in carnivores.[100][101]

        Leopards are mainly active from dusk till dawn and will rest for most of the day and some hours at night in
        thickets, among rocks or over tree branches. Leopards have been observed walking 1–25 km (0.62–15.53 mi) across
        their range at night; wandering up to 75 km (47 mi) if disturbed.[65][75] In some regions, they are
        nocturnal.[102][103] In western African forests, they have been observed to be largely diurnal and hunting
        during twilight, when their prey animals are active; activity patterns vary between seasons.[104]
